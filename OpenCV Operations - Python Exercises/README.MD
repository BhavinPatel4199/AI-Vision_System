# OpenCV Operations - Python Exercises

## Overview

- This repository contains a series of exercises designed to help you get familiar with various OpenCV operations using Python.
- The exercises are aimed at understanding image processing techniques such as image resizing, color space conversions, drawing shapes, applying filters, and performing edge detection.


## Dataset : 
- Images used for this exercise are uploaded in repository feel free to use you own images for further analysis. 

## Contents

- **Question 1:** Reading and displaying the shape and size of an image.
- **Question 2:** Creating and displaying black and white images using NumPy arrays.
- **Question 3:** Displaying RGB channels and converting an image to HSV color space.
- **Question 4:** Creating and manipulating arrays, including finding max/min values and manipulating image channels.
- **Question 5:** Performing image scaling with different dimensions and interpolation methods.
- **Question 6:** Drawing shapes, cropping, and rotating regions of interest in images.
- **Question 7:** Applying thresholding, morphological operations, and edge detection.
- **Question 8:** Flipping images, drawing shapes, and modifying images.
- **Question 9:** Interactive script for drawing circles on an image with mouse clicks.
- **Question 10:** Applying filters, convolution, Sobel filtering, and displaying color histograms.
